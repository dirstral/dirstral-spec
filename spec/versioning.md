# Versioning Policy

## Spec versioning

The spec uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Change type | Version bump |
|-------------|-------------|
| Breaking wire/schema behavior | Major |
| New optional fields, new optional tools | Minor |
| Clarifications, doc fixes | Patch |

**Pre-1.0 (beta) policy.** While the spec is `0.x` the project is pre-institutional and treated as **beta**: the `MAJOR` component stays `0`; **both** breaking wire/schema changes **and** new optional fields/tools bump the `MINOR` (e.g. `0.4.0 → 0.5.0`); only clarifications/doc-fixes bump the `PATCH`. (The SemVer table above describes post-`1.0` semantics — breaking → `MAJOR`, new optional → `MINOR` — and takes effect at `1.0.0`. The "Non-breaking additions" section below remains accurate: new optional surface is a `MINOR` bump in either regime.)

**Current spec version:** `0.21.0`
**MCP protocol target:** `2025-11-25`

## Implementation compatibility

Each implementation declares the spec version(s) it supports. `dirstral-cli` validates the supported spec version at runtime during `initialize`.

## Compatibility matrix

| Impl | Supported spec versions | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| `dir2mcp` (Go) | `0.14.x` (pending) | Reference implementation used for spec validation; reviewed against `internal/` as of 2026-06-04. The spec is authoritative — when discrepancies arise, maintainers file a spec-gap issue and decide whether to correct the spec or the implementation. Native Gemini embedding parity (`taskType`, MRL `outputDimensionality`, #222) and native Gemini STT/TTS (#223) shipped. The multimodal-embedding arc (`gemini-embedding-2`, §8.1.7) shipped phased + default-off: adapter slice (#224), image ingestion (#225), per-page PDF (#226), audio/video time-window embedding (#227, `0.14.0`), retrieval dedup + result modality (#228), and `open_file` `MEDIA_NO_TEXT` + ask-over-media grounding (#229); docling adapter contract CI (#230). The model is Public Preview, so this row stays pending until the implementation releases against the GA-verified model. For `0.15.0` (extractor availability): the docling venv is version-locked and the docling subprocess runs with a sanitized environment (#234) so a present-but-broken docling degrades gracefully; the functional-check + `auto` fallback land in a follow-up code PR. For `0.16.0` (dual-machine + media, #239/#251): the remote-source/backend-tier and media transcription/translation/subtitle surfaces are spec-led and land in follow-up code PRs (gated submodule re-pin); the media surface is **Planned**. For `0.17.0` (media clip citations #264 + speaker diarization #266): both are additive media-retrieval contracts (`dir2mcp_open_media_clip` over the existing `avutil.ExtractSegment` seam; optional, off-by-default, provider-dependent diarization carried on transcript spans/meta) and are spec-led, **Planned**, landing in follow-up code PRs. Row stays pending until those ship. |
| `dirstral-cli` | `0.4.x` | MUST update to `0.7.x` before releasing against spec `0.7.0`. No client code change for `0.6.0`/`0.7.0` (reranking and multi-provider selection are server-side; the wire/result contract is unchanged); the `0.5.0` tool-name rename remains the only wire-visible delta in this range. |
| `landfall` | TBD | |

## Contract freeze (issue #104)

As of spec version `0.4.0`, the following machine-readable artifacts have been added:

- `spec/tools/schemas/` — JSON Schema Draft-07 files for all 9 tools
- `spec/errors/taxonomy.md` — complete error code table including tool-execution errors
- `spec/sessions/lifecycle.md` — session expiry and `X-MCP-Session-Expired` header documented
- `spec/x402/extension.md` — `upto` scheme and `maxAmountRequired` field documented

Spec gaps identified during the review (see `<!-- spec-gap: ... -->` comments in each file):

- `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` JSON-RPC code was documented as `-32002`; implementation uses `-32001`
- `UNAUTHORIZED` JSON-RPC code was documented as `-32001`; implementation uses `-32000`
- Error `data` envelope (`{"code": ..., "retryable": ...}`) was not documented
- Tool execution errors return HTTP 200 with `isError: true`; this was not explicitly stated
- Several error codes (`MISSING_FIELD`, `INVALID_FIELD`, `INVALID_RANGE`, `STORE_CORRUPT`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `FORBIDDEN_ORIGIN`, `METHOD_NOT_FOUND`) were absent from the taxonomy

## 0.21.0 — CorpusFS abstraction + distributed embedding (coordinator + workers)

Completes the distributed-ingest governance gate (dir2mcp #239) by adding the two
contracts the `0.16.0` dual-machine surface (§6, §7.8, §8.5) did not yet pin: the
**CorpusFS** corpus-filesystem abstraction (dir2mcp #242) and the **distributed
embedding** coordinator/worker job-queue contract (dir2mcp #248 distributed
workers, dir2mcp #249 standalone embed-worker mode). `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0
policy; fully **additive** and **off by default** — the local-first single-binary
deployment (§1.2) runs the in-process embedding loop with no broker and no
external store, exactly as before.

**New surface:**

- §7.10 **(new) CorpusFS — corpus filesystem abstraction** — formalizes the
  backend-neutral **logical contract** that the §7.8 schemes (`local`/`nfs`/`s3`)
  implement, so discovery and media byte-reads work against any backing store
  without callers caring. Three capabilities: **list** (enumerate with `rel_path`
  + size + the backend's cheap change signal — `(size,mtime)` for fs, **ETag** for
  s3, §7.8), **stat** (single-`rel_path` metadata; a missing path is
  distinguishable from an error → drives the deletion/tombstone path), and
  **open / range-read** (random-access ranged reads, required for media windowing
  §8.1.7, per-page PDF, and `open_media_clip` §15.11). Invariants:
  backend-independent identity (`rel_path`/`content_hash` identical across schemes
  ⇒ `local⇄nfs⇄s3` relocation forces no reindex, §7.8), `PATH_OUTSIDE_ROOT`
  isolation on every capability (§17), state-stays-local + read-only-corpus
  (§1.2). No new config (the §16.2 `source:` block already selects the backing
  store). **Status: Planned.**
- §8.7 **(new) Distributed embedding (coordinator + workers)** — **optional,
  off-by-default** contract for embedding a corpus with multiple workers on
  separate machines (GPU pool) instead of the in-process loop; the single-binary
  default is the degenerate one-process case (§1.2). (8.7.1) **roles** —
  coordinator owns discovery/chunking/store/serve/retrieval + enqueues `pending`
  chunks (§5.3); stateless **embed-workers** pull jobs, read corpus bytes directly
  via CorpusFS (§7.10), embed via the configured provider (typically a co-located
  self-hosted endpoint §8.5), and write vectors + status back to the **shared**
  store. (8.7.2) **job description** — corpus ref (`corpus_id` + `source`), chunk
  identity (`chunk_id` + `index_kind`), payload identity (`text_hash`, or
  media `rel_path`+span for §8.1.7 media chunks), and the **embed identity**
  (§8.1.4) the job was enqueued under; workers read bytes directly from source
  (not relayed). (8.7.3) **idempotency/ordering** — at-least-once delivery,
  idempotent `chunk_id`-keyed writes (re-run = no-op, no duplicate vectors), no
  global ordering (partial-index retrieval, §1.2), per-job embed-identity
  enforcement (mismatch ⇒ fail, never mix spaces, §6.4), non-fatal failures with
  redelivery/dead-letter + lease expiry for crashed workers, tombstone safety
  (§6.6). (8.7.4) **shared store + broker** — a distributed pool REQUIRES a
  **Tier C** external store (§6.2/§6.3) reachable by all participants (the
  embedded Tier A/B are single-node); the broker is implementation-defined
  (NATS/Redis/SQS — any at-least-once + redelivery + dead-letter), credentials per
  §16.1.1 (never persisted); capability-driven + off by default; the standalone
  embed-worker run mode (dir2mcp #249) is the worker role without serving.
  **Status: Planned.**

**No change to:** the persisted store shape (§5), embed identity (§8.1.4),
retrieval/answer contract (§9), the MCP tool surface (§12–§15), the error taxonomy
(§14), or the §8.1.2 capability matrix. No new tool, error code, span kind, or
wire-contract change; the distributed mode changes **where** embedding runs, not
**what** is persisted. The existing `0.16.0` remote-source (§7.8), backend-tier
(§6), and self-hosted-endpoint (§8.5) contracts are referenced, not modified.

**Config:** no new keys. CorpusFS is selected by the existing §16.2 `source:`
block; the distributed mode reuses the existing Tier C `index:` connection (§16.2)
and adds only implementation-defined broker connection parameters (resolved per
§16.1.1, never persisted), out of scope for the normative template.

**Implementation note:** lands in follow-up dir2mcp code PRs once this spec change
is merged (gated submodule re-pin): CorpusFS local+S3 (#242), distributed workers
via job queue (#248), and the standalone embed-worker CLI mode (#249). These build
on the already-merged corpus-source config (#244) and self-hosted endpoints (#240)
under the same epic (#250).

## 0.20.0 — transcription word-level timing + bilingual subtitle export + batch ergonomics

Completes the §8.6 media surface for the `livevtt archive_transcriber` absorption
(dir2mcp #251) by adding the three downstream contracts that §8.6.1–§8.6.8 left
open: word-level timestamp normalization/surfacing (#252), bilingual TTML + SMIL
packaging (#255), and two-phase batch + progress/manifest ergonomics (#260).
`MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy; **fully additive** and consistent with the
existing transcript-span (§8.6.1), diarization (§8.6.8), and media-chunk-window
behavior — every new surface is **optional and off/segment-level by default**, so a
conforming deployment behaves unchanged.

**New media subsections (all Status: Planned, domain-general — no language/
broadcaster specifics):**

- §8.6.9 **(new) Word-level timing: capture, normalization, and surfacing**
  (#252) — refines §8.6.1's per-word rule. Granularity is **recorded** via the
  `meta_json.words` flag, not assumed; absent ⇒ segment-only, graceful-degrade.
  Defines normalization of an OpenAI-compatible / faster-whisper `verbose_json`
  `words` array (`{word,start,end}` seconds) into the §8.6.1 `{t,d,w}` ms shape
  (deterministic round-half-up) as a **sibling** parser to the existing Mistral
  `[mm:ss]` segment path. Reaffirms `words` is metadata-only (no extra chunks, no
  text/boundary change ⇒ citation-stable). A `time` span MAY OPTIONALLY narrow to
  word boundaries **within** its segment without adding/dropping hits; citation
  syntax `[path@t=<start>-<end>]` is **unchanged** (bounds MAY be word-snapped).
- §8.6.10 **(new) Bilingual subtitle export (TTML + SMIL)** (#255) — refines
  §8.6.3's optional/off-by-default TTML/SMIL. Per-cue primary + secondary language
  text aligned to the **same** segment time region, each run `xml:lang`-tagged,
  both tracing back to the same transcript span. Deterministic cross-language cue
  alignment within `media.subtitles.ttml.align_tolerance_ms` (default `2500`);
  unmatched secondary cues are emitted, not dropped. SMIL packaging carries probed
  track metadata (codec/bitrate/width/height via `ffprobe`/`avutil`) and references
  the subtitle docs. **Fail-open** on missing metadata (omit SMIL, keep text
  subtitles). Missing-language export = `INVALID_FIELD`; bilingual requires
  translation (§8.6.2) or degrades to monolingual. Speaker voice markup per §8.6.8.
- §8.6.11 **(new) Two-phase batch transcription, progress, and run manifest**
  (#260) — opt-in two-pass ingest (transcribe-all, then translate/export) that is
  **observably output-equivalent** to single-pass (ordering/reporting only),
  independently resumable via existing identity/cache state (§7.6/§8.6.7). Optional
  **side-channel** progress that never affects output, monotonic against a
  pass-start total (cache hits count as completed). A **JSONL run manifest** (one
  record/asset) recording at least `rel_path` + `content_hash`, terminal `status`
  (+ canonical §14.4 error code), `duration_ms`, processing time, and outputs
  produced; **advisory for resume** only — live identity/cache/mtime gates win.
  Deterministic asset ordering. Worker-pool / multi-GPU distribution is out of scope.

**Supporting edits:**

- §8.6.1 — cross-references §8.6.9 for word normalization/surfacing.
- §8.6.3 — cross-references §8.6.10 for the bilingual TTML/SMIL contract.
- §9.3 **citation formatting** — transcript bounds MAY be word-snapped (§8.6.9);
  syntax unchanged.
- §16.2 **config template** — `media.subtitles.ttml.align_tolerance_ms` (default
  2500) and a new `media.batch:` block (`two_phase`/`progress`/`manifest`, all
  off/empty by default).
- Implementation note: lands in follow-up dir2mcp code PRs (#252/#255/#260) once
  this spec change is merged (gated submodule re-pin); the surfaces are **Planned**.

## 0.19.0 — diarization speaker-aligned chunk boundary

Refines the §8.6.8 speaker-diarization contract (dir2mcp #266) so it is
internally consistent and implementable. The original wording said diarization
changes neither chunk `text` nor segment boundaries, but the one-`speaker`-per-
span model (§5.4/§9.3) cannot hold when the char-budget chunker merges cues
across speaker turns. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (normative behavior
refinement on an opt-in, default-off path).

- §8.6.8 — clarifies that diarization is metadata-only for transcript **content**
  (never edits/reorders/re-times text) but MAY introduce a **chunk boundary at a
  speaker change** so every emitted chunk carries a single `speaker`. This
  speaker-aligned split is the **only** boundary effect permitted, applies **only
  when diarization is active**, and a transcript with no speaker attribution MUST
  chunk **identically** to the non-diarized path (default-off ⇒ unchanged).

## 0.18.0 — cross-file dedup & canonicalization

General corpus hygiene (dir2mcp #265): real corpora contain duplicates — the same
content at multiple paths, mirrored directories, byte-identical copies — and
indexing every copy bloats the index and returns the same content multiple times
per query. This release adds an **optional, off-by-default** cross-file
canonicalization surface. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy; fully additive
(default-off ⇒ behavior unchanged).

**New surface:**

- §7.9 **Cross-file canonicalization (optional)** (new) — `dedup.exact: true`
  groups documents by identical `content_hash` (§7.6) into a **duplicate group**,
  selects one **canonical** document deterministically (`dedup.select: best|first`,
  sharing the media-variant selection vocabulary, §8.6.5), and generates
  representations/chunks/embeddings **only for the canonical**. Non-canonical
  members become **aliases** (discoverable + resolvable, but zero chunks/hits).
  Canonical removal **promotes** an alias. Near-duplicate (similarity) detection is
  explicitly **out of scope / future** and, if added, MUST stay opt-in.
- §9.2 **Cross-file de-duplication at retrieval** (addendum) — `dedup.retrieval:
  true` collapses candidate hits whose documents share a duplicate group to a
  single best-ranked survivor, **before** reranking and truncation to `k`. The
  candidate *pool* shrinks, not the rerank output, so the §9.1.1 **no-result-loss**
  guarantee is preserved (defined relative to the de-duplicated pool); a query MAY
  therefore return fewer than `k` hits when the corpus lacks `k` distinct results.
  Works whether or not ingest-time canonicalization is enabled.
- §5.1 `documents` (addendum) — optional `canonical_doc_id` / `is_alias` columns;
  alias rows share the canonical `content_hash` and hold no representations.
- §8.6.5 (addendum) — media variant selection is documented as the media-specific
  special case of §7.9, sharing the `best|first` selection vocabulary.

**Config (additive, default-off):** `dedup.exact` (bool), `dedup.select`
(`best|first`), `dedup.retrieval` (bool).

## 0.17.0 — media clip citations + speaker diarization

Two coordinated media-retrieval feature contracts land together to avoid a
SPEC.md collision: **media clip citations** (dir2mcp #264) and **speaker
diarization** (dir2mcp #266). Both build on the `0.16.0` media surface (§8.6) and
are **additive** — `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (new optional tool, new
optional fields, new error codes; no breaking wire/schema change). Both ship
**Status: Planned**; implementation lands in follow-up dir2mcp code PRs (gated
submodule re-pin).

**(A) Media clip citations (#264):**

- §13.2 **Recommended extended tools** — adds `dir2mcp_open_media_clip`, the
  time-media analogue of `dir2mcp_open_file`: given a `chunk_id` (or
  `rel_path` + `start_ms`/`end_ms`), it extracts the **actual audio/video snippet**
  for the hit's `time` span (via the existing `avutil.ExtractSegment` seam) and
  returns it `inline` (base64) or by `reference` (short-lived `uri`).
- §15.11 **(new) `dir2mcp_open_media_clip`** — full input/output schema; selection
  rules (chunk-id resolution vs. explicit range); **normative bounds**
  (`media.clip.max_duration_ms` default 120000, `media.clip.max_bytes` default
  25 MiB); relationship to `open_file` (text vs. bytes for the same span);
  optional word-level deep-link refinement (§8.6.1 word spans); exclusion-engine
  and x402 gating inherited from `open_file`.
- §14.2 / §14.4 — new error codes `CLIP_TOO_LARGE` (bounds rejection,
  non-retryable) and `MEDIA_CLIP_FAILED` (extraction failure), distinct from the
  existing `MEDIA_NO_TEXT` on `open_file`.
- §16.2 — new `media.clip.{max_duration_ms,max_bytes}` config keys.
- New machine-readable contract `spec/tools/schemas/open_media_clip.json`;
  `spec/tools/schemas.md` index updated.

**(B) Speaker diarization (#266, Status: Planned):**

- §8.6.8 **(new) Speaker diarization** — **optional, off by default,
  provider-dependent** (requires a diarization-capable STT backend, §8.5). Speaker
  attribution is **metadata only** (does not change chunk `text` or segment
  boundaries). `media.diarize.enabled` is tri-state (omit ⇒ auto-enable when the
  backend advertises the capability; `false` ⇒ force off; `true` ⇒ require it,
  `CONFIG_INVALID` if absent). Speaker ids MUST be stable/deterministic across
  re-indexing; the diarization provider/model joins the transcript derivation
  identity (§8.6.7). Sidecar voice markup (WebVTT `<v>`) MAY populate speakers
  without a model derivation.
- §5.4 **spans** — `time`-span `extra_json` MAY carry `speaker` (stable id) and
  optional `speaker_label`; additive (consumers degrade to a flat citation).
- §5.2 **transcript meta_json** — adds `diarized`, `diarize_provider`,
  `diarize_model`, and a `speakers` set.
- §9.2 / §9.3 — a `time` hit `span` MAY surface `speaker`/`speaker_label`; human
  citations MAY append the speaker (e.g. `[interview.mp4@t=02:13-02:41 › S2]`).
- §15.2 **`dir2mcp_search`** — adds an optional `speaker` filter (restricts
  time-spanned transcript hits); `spec/tools/schemas/search.json` updated.
- §15.1.1 **`Span`** / `spec/tools/schemas/common.json` — the `time` variant gains
  optional `speaker`/`speaker_label` properties.
- §16.2 — new `media.diarize` config block.

No breaking wire/schema change; clients that ignore the new optional tool, fields,
and error codes interoperate unchanged.

## 0.16.0 — dual-machine corpus/index + media transcription surface

Two coordinated governance gates land together: the **dual-machine contract**
(remote corpus sources + pluggable vector-index backends, dir2mcp #239) and the
**media transcription/translation/subtitle surface** (absorbing the retired
`livevtt archive_transcriber`, dir2mcp #251). `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy.

> **Partly breaking — invariant relaxation.** This release **relaxes the
> long-standing "no external vector DB / no Qdrant" invariant** (§1.2, §19). The
> embedded, zero-infra index stays the **default** (Tier A), but an external
> vector store (Qdrant/pgvector, Tier C) MAY now be configured — it is
> **optional and never required**. A conforming deployment still runs with zero
> external infrastructure beyond model providers. Under the pre-1.0 policy a
> breaking change is still a `MINOR` bump.

**Dual-machine contract (#239):**

- §1.2 **Invariants** — the two vector-DB lines are replaced: default index is
  embedded/on-disk (no external service); an external store MAY be configured but
  MUST NOT be required; the state dir is always local even when the corpus root is
  remote.
- §6 **Vector index backends and identity** (rewritten from "Embedded ANN
  indices") — `index.backend` selector + tier table: `memory` (Tier A, in-memory
  pure-Go HNSW, **default**), `disk` (Tier B, pure-Go on-disk/memmapped,
  single-node), `qdrant`/`pgvector` (Tier C, external, optional-never-required).
  Two logical axes (text/code) with `chunk_id` as label/payload key. Embed
  identity (§8.1.4) binds **every** backend; Tier C is addressed by a
  collection/namespace derived from `corpus_id`; an unreachable Tier C at
  preflight fails `CONFIG_INVALID` (no silent fallback). New normative pure-Go /
  `CGO_ENABLED=0` subsection that explicitly **rejects `sqlite-vec`**. Tier C MAY
  delete natively while honoring the SQLite tombstone.
- §7.8 **(new) Remote corpus sources** — `source.kind` ∈ `local|nfs|s3`;
  filesystem walk for local/nfs, object enumeration for s3. `rel_path` is stable
  across schemes (s3 = object key minus prefix) so a corpus relocates
  local⇄nfs⇄s3 without changing identity; root-escape protections apply to every
  scheme. Change detection: (size, mtime)+content_hash for local/nfs; ETag (not
  MD5 for multipart/SSE-KMS) as the cheap signal for s3, with content_hash still
  reading the body. Missing object → tombstone. State dir stays local.
- §8.5 **(new) Self-hosted / OpenAI-compatible provider endpoints** — a
  self-hosted model server is first-class via the existing `kind: openai` contract
  (no new kind); MAY be credential-less and still auto-selectable. Capability
  mapping (embed/chat/stt via `/v1/embeddings`,`/v1/chat/completions`,
  `/v1/audio/transcriptions`; ocr has no OpenAI analog; STT validated at first
  use). Self-hosted embed bound by embed identity; STT normalization deferred to
  §8.6. No shipped self-hosted default.
- §19 **Non-goals** — external stores reframed as optional-never-required;
  `sqlite-vec` rejected (C extension); embedded no-in-place-delete retained, Tier
  C native delete allowed while honoring the tombstone.

**Media contract (#251, Status: Planned):**

- §8.6 **(new) Media transcription, translation, and subtitle surface** —
  domain-general, no language/broadcaster specifics. (8.6.1) transcript = TEXT
  with `time` spans, per-segment timestamps MUST when returned, per-word MAY in
  `spans.extra_json.words` ({t,d,w}) without extra chunks, no-timestamp fallback
  flagged `timing:"estimated"`, deterministic windowing. (8.6.2) source
  auto-detected (optional pin), translation opt-in/off by default, target langs
  configurable with no default (enabling with none = `CONFIG_INVALID`),
  per-language keying (`TranscriptLangSuffix`), translated transcripts record
  source_language + translate provider/model. (8.6.3) VTT/SRT always available
  (no re-transcription), TTML/SMIL optional/off (fail-open), missing language =
  `INVALID_FIELD`. (8.6.4) sidecar `.vtt/.srt/.ttml` ingested as transcript
  instead of STT, mtime-gated, `--force` overrides, multiple → per-language.
  (8.6.5) variant grouping, transcribe canonical/best once, no duplicate
  chunks/embeddings. (8.6.6) degenerate-output quality gates (empty/repetition/
  low-density; flag detected≠pinned) → non-fatal `TRANSCRIBE_FAILED`/`OCR_FAILED`/
  `TRANSLATE_FAILED`, deterministic. (8.6.7) representation provenance +
  derivation identity {capability,provider,model,version,language}; mismatch →
  re-derive+re-chunk+re-embed (per-representation analogue of embed-identity →
  reindex); sidecar transcripts are not model-derived.

**Supporting edits (both):**

- §5.2 **transcript meta_json** — provider enum no longer closed to
  `mistral|elevenlabs`; adds `model_version`, `timing`, `words`, `source`;
  translated transcripts add `source_language`/`translate_provider`/
  `translate_model`.
- §14.4 **error taxonomy** — new `TRANSLATE_FAILED`; `TRANSCRIBE_FAILED`/
  `OCR_FAILED` noted to also cover degenerate-output rejection. Mirrored in
  `spec/errors/taxonomy.md` (new Ingestion/extraction section).
- §16.2 **config template** — new `source:` block (`kind` local|nfs|s3 + s3
  bucket/prefix/region/endpoint, credentials per §16.1.1, never persisted), new
  `index:` block (`backend` memory|disk|qdrant|pgvector, default memory; Tier C
  connection optional), and new `media:` block (translate off + empty targets;
  subtitles vtt/srt + ttml off; sidecars on; variants group/best; quality_gate
  thresholds).
- §15.6 / §15.7 / `spec/tools/schemas/{stats,transcribe,transcribe_and_ask}.json`
  — `stt_provider` relaxed from the closed `["mistral","elevenlabs"]` enum to an
  open string (any STT-capable provider per §8.2/§8.5), matching the §5.2 change.
- Section-number map: §8.5 = self-hosted endpoints, §8.6 = media surface (both
  after §8.4 Rerank; resolves the dual-draft "§8.5" collision).
- Implementation note: both contracts land in follow-up dir2mcp code PRs once
  this spec change is merged (gated submodule re-pin). The media surface is
  **Planned** and ships phased.

## 0.15.0 — extractor availability (functional check)

Refines §7.4 so an extractor counts as *available* only when it can actually
run, not merely when it is configured. The `docling` CLI must both resolve and
pass a lightweight functional probe; a present-but-non-functional command (e.g.
a bundled virtualenv with ABI-incompatible dependencies) is **unavailable**,
exactly as an unreachable `serve_url` already makes `docling-serve` unavailable.
`MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (changes `auto` selection behavior; no new
tool, error code, config field, span kind, or wire-contract change). The §8.1.2
capability matrix is unchanged.

- §7.4 **(new) Extractor availability** — availability = resolves **and** passes
  a functional check; implementations SHOULD probe and MUST treat a
  present-but-broken extractor as unavailable, caching the result for the run.
- §7.4 **graceful degradation** — under `extractor: auto` an unavailable docling
  CLI is skipped and the cascade continues (docling-serve → Mistral OCR →
  disabled) instead of failing every document; under explicit `extractor:
  docling` an unavailable command disables extraction with no silent fallback,
  mirroring explicit `docling-serve`.
- §7.4 / §7.7 — the availability decision and its reason MUST be surfaced in
  startup diagnostics and `dir2mcp doctor`, so a broken extractor is visible
  rather than reported as healthy.
- No new tool, error code, config field, span kind, or wire-contract change.
- Implementation note: lands in a follow-up dir2mcp code PR (`doctor` functional
  probe + `auto` fallback). The dependency lock (homebrew-tap) and docling
  subprocess env isolation (#234) that make the bundled venv reproducible and
  immune to host-Python shadowing ship alongside.

## 0.14.0 — audio/video media windowing

Extends the multimodal-embedding surface (0.13.0, §8.1.7) with normative
**time-window chunking** for audio and video direct embedding under
`model.embed.multimodal` `augment`/`replace`, completing the modality set
after images and PDFs. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (refines optional
multimodal behavior; no new tool, error code, config field, span kind, or
wire-contract change — `time` spans already exist, §5.4). The §8.1.2
capability matrix is unchanged.

- §8.1.7 **(new) Media chunking (windowing)** — audio/video are split into
  non-overlapping, contiguous **time windows** (one media chunk each, `time`
  span) that MUST respect both the per-modality duration cap (audio ≤ 180 s,
  video ≤ 120 s) and the unified 8192-token budget; window boundaries are
  deterministic for stable citations. Image = one chunk; PDF = one chunk/page.
- §8.1.7 **fallback** — a file whose duration cannot be determined is a
  non-fatal per-document condition (§7.7): not directly embedded, warned;
  modalities with a text path (image/PDF OCR, audio transcript) keep that text
  representation even under `replace`, while video (no text path) is left
  unindexed.
- §8.1.7 **video** — has no default text representation (no video→text
  analogue to audio STT, §7.4.C): searchable only via media windows.
- §5.1 / §7.3 — `video` added to the `documents.doc_type` enumeration and the
  type-classification list (`.mp4`, `.mov`).
- No new tool, error code, config field, span kind, or wire-contract change.
- Implementation note: lands in a follow-up dir2mcp code PR (Phase 2c); the
  reference impl reads media duration via an `ffprobe` subprocess with a
  graceful skip when absent.

## 0.13.0 — multimodal embeddings (gemini-embedding-2)

Promotes [Design 0003](../docs/design/0003-multimodal-embeddings.md) to normative
spec: optional native **multimodal embeddings** that map text + images + audio +
video + PDFs into one shared vector space, via Google `gemini-embedding-2`,
behind a per-corpus `model.embed.multimodal` toggle. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0
policy (new optional config + one new tool-execution error code; no wire/tool
shape change). The §8.1.2 capability matrix is unchanged — multimodality is a
property of the chosen embed model, not a new capability cell. The model is
**Public Preview**: §8.1.7 carries a re-verify caveat and the implementation is
phased + GA-gated (compatibility row stays pending).

- §8.1.7 **(new) Multimodal embeddings** — `gemini-embedding-2`, modalities +
  per-request limits + the unified 8192-token window, the
  `model.embed.multimodal` (`off|augment|replace`) toggle, the single-shared-
  space constraint (`augment`/`replace` ⇒ `gemini-embedding-2` for all
  modalities, else `CONFIG_INVALID`), reindex-bound mode, provenance reusing
  existing span kinds, the page-image retrieval dedup rule, the `ask` grounding
  rule, and inspection via `MEDIA_NO_TEXT`.
- §8.1.4 **embed identity** — gains the multimodal mode.
- §14.2 **error taxonomy** — new non-retryable `MEDIA_NO_TEXT` (`open_file` on a
  `replace`-mode media chunk with no text representation); mirrored in
  `spec/errors/taxonomy.md`.
- §15.4 **`open_file`** — documents the `MEDIA_NO_TEXT` outcome.
- §16.2 **config template** — `model.embed.multimodal` (default `off`).
- No new tool, span kind, or wire-contract change.
- Implementation note: lands in phased follow-up dir2mcp code PRs (adapter →
  ingestion → store → retrieval → `ask` → `replace`), starting with the
  default-off adapter slice; preview limits/endpoints re-verified at GA.

## 0.12.0 — native Gemini STT/TTS

Pins the native wire mechanism for the already-`✅` Gemini STT and TTS
capability cells (8.1.2). Gemini's OpenAI-compatible layer does not expose
`/v1/audio/*`, so audio must use the native `models/{model}:generateContent`
surface — this release makes that normative and defines the TTS audio
container. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (provider-behavior change on
already-`✅` matrix cells; no new tool, error code, config field, or
wire-contract change — STT/TTS knobs `stt_model`/`stt_language`/`tts_model`/
`tts_voice` already exist since 0.7.0).

- §8.1.1 **provider profiles**: `gemini` STT/TTS clarified as native
  (`generateContent`); the `kind: openai` Gemini path serves chat only.
- §8.2 **STT**: Gemini transcribes via `generateContent` with the audio as
  an inline-data part; output normalized to the `transcript` representation
  like every other provider. `stt_model` default `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- §8.3 **TTS**: Gemini synthesizes via `generateContent` with
  `generationConfig.responseModalities: ["AUDIO"]` + a `speechConfig` voice (`tts_voice`,
  default `Kore`; `tts_model` default `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`). The
  returned raw PCM (s16le, 24 kHz, mono) MUST be wrapped in a WAV container
  so the bytes are directly playable, matching ElevenLabs/OpenAI. TTS stays
  fail-open (8.3).
- No new tool, error code, config field, span kind, or wire-contract
  change; the §8.1.2 matrix is unchanged (`gemini` STT/TTS were already `✅`).
- Implementation note: the native Gemini STT/TTS backend lands in a
  follow-up dir2mcp code PR once this spec change is merged (replacing the
  current OpenAI-compat `/audio/*` shim, which Gemini does not serve).

## 0.11.0 — native Gemini embedding parity (taskType + Matryoshka)

Promotes the `gemini` embed adapter from the OpenAI-compatible shim to Gemini's
**native** embed surface so it reaches feature parity with `gemini-embedding-001`:
asymmetric `taskType` (document/query, with a code-aware refinement) and
configurable Matryoshka output dimensionality. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0
policy (new optional config fields + provider-behavior change on an already-`✅`
matrix cell; no new tool, error code, or wire-contract change). The §8.1.2
matrix is unchanged (`gemini` embed was already `✅`).

- §8.1.1 **provider profiles**: `gemini` embed clarified as native, **asymmetric**
  via `taskType`, with Matryoshka output dimensionality; the OpenAI-compatible
  alternative forgoes `taskType` and stays symmetric.
- §8.1.4 **embed identity**: the requested output dimension joins provider+model
  in the corpus-lifetime embed identity (recorded as `embed_text_dim`/
  `embed_code_dim`, §5.5); changing it forces a reindex / `CONFIG_INVALID`.
- §8.1.5 **asymmetric embeddings**: `gemini` added alongside Cohere/Voyage. Role
  mapping: `document`→`RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`, `query`→`RETRIEVAL_QUERY`; for the
  configured **code** model a `query` maps to `CODE_RETRIEVAL_QUERY`.
- §8.1.6 **configurable embedding dimensionality (Matryoshka/MRL)** (new):
  optional `model.embed.text_dim`/`code_dim`; adapters request `outputDimensionality`
  where supported and **re-normalize** truncated vectors; unsupported dimensions
  are `CONFIG_INVALID`, never silently ignored.
- §16.2 **config template**: `model.embed` gains optional `text_dim`/`code_dim`
  (commented; native dimension when omitted). No provider/matrix change.
- No new tool, error code, span kind, or wire-contract change. STT/TTS remain
  `✅` in the matrix; native Gemini STT/TTS implementation is a separate slice.
- Implementation note: the native Gemini embedding backend (and, separately,
  native Gemini STT/TTS) land in follow-up dir2mcp code PRs once this spec
  change is merged.

## 0.10.0 — docling-serve HTTP extraction transport (docling-serve)

Adds `docling-serve` as an `ingest.extractor` value: an alternative *transport*
for docling extraction that talks to a local docling-serve HTTP container
instead of the docling CLI subprocess. Extraction remains its own selection axis
(`ingest.extractor`), independent of the §8 model/provider bindings — it is
deliberately **not** modeled as a provider capability (the §8.1.2 matrix is
unchanged). `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (new optional `ingest.extractor`
value + one new optional config field, non-breaking). Output is byte-identical
to the docling CLI path (same `extracted_markdown` + `region` spans from 0.9.0).

- §7.4.B **representation**: `ingest.extractor` gains `docling-serve`. The `ingest.extractor` value selects the transport explicitly (`docling` = CLI subprocess, `docling-serve` = HTTP service); both transports MUST produce identical output, and extraction is independent of the §8 provider bindings. Selecting `docling-serve` requires a non-empty, reachable `serve_url`; an empty or unreachable endpoint disables that extractor for diagnostics (§7.7), like a missing docling binary, and MUST NOT silently fall back to the CLI. (Under `extractor: auto` the transport is implementation-determined.)
- §16.2 **config template**: add `ingest.docling.serve_url` (empty by default; required when `extractor=docling-serve`, otherwise the HTTP transport is simply not used). One new optional config field; no provider/matrix change.
- No new tool, error code, span kind, provider kind, or wire-contract change. The MCP tool surface and persisted store shape are unchanged.
- Implementation note: the dir2mcp docling-serve backend lands in a follow-up code PR once this spec change is merged (HTTP extractor reusing the existing DoclingDocument parser; doctor probes the endpoint's `/ready`). Container lifecycle is user-managed (dir2mcp probes and fails fast; it does not start/stop the container).

## 0.9.0 — structured docling extraction (region provenance)

Formalizes structured `DoclingDocument` ingestion as the docling extraction contract (previously flat Markdown) and adds region-level provenance for precise citations. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (new optional span kind + new optional citation fields, non-breaking — clients that ignore the new fields continue to work). Design: [docs/design/0002-structured-extraction.md](../docs/design/0002-structured-extraction.md).

- §5.4 **spans**: new `region` span kind — page range in `start`/`end`, with `bbox` (primary-page bounding box), `section` breadcrumb, and element `label` carried in the existing `extra_json` column. **No schema migration** (reuses `extra_json`).
- §7.4.B **representation**: structured extraction preserves reading order, section hierarchy, per-element page/bbox provenance, atomic tables, and figure captions/classifications; title from the model's title element. The persisted `extracted_markdown` representation remains rendered Markdown (structure lands in spans); raw `DoclingDocument` JSON is an implementation-private cache, not a representation. Page-separated OCR fallback (Mistral) is unchanged.
- §7.5 **chunking**: section/element-aware chunking for structured documents (group by section breadcrumb, keep tables atomic).
- §15.1.1 **`Span`** (client-facing) + `spec/tools/schemas/common.json`: additive `region` variant (`start_page`/`end_page`, required `bbox`, optional `section`). A `region` span always carries a `bbox` — an element without provenance is recorded as a `page` span instead. The machine-readable `common.json` `Span` (previously the drifted minimal `{start,end}` shape) is brought in line with the kind-tagged `§15.1.1` union (`lines|page|time|region|document`) so the authoritative JSON schema matches the prose. Backward compatible — existing kinds unchanged; clients MUST ignore unrecognized kinds/fields.
- §9.2 **result objects** / §9.3 **citation rendering**: `region` added to the hit span-kind list; region citations render the primary page (`bbox.page`), or a page range when `start_page != end_page`, optionally suffixed with the section breadcrumb.
- No new tool, no new error code, no config-shape change. `spec/errors/taxonomy.md` and `spec/sessions/lifecycle.md` are unaffected (header version bump only). A new `dirstral-conformance` test for the `region` span variant is recommended-not-required.
- Implementation note: the structured pipeline lands in a follow-up dir2mcp PR (extractor → `--to json`, store `extra_json` read/write, section-aware chunking, retrieval + MCP citation surface) once this spec change is merged.

## 0.8.0 — stats.recent_failures (per-document failure visibility)

Extends `dir2mcp_stats` output with an **optional** `recent_failures` array surfacing the most-recent documents with `status='error'` along with a short, sanitized `error_message`. `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (new optional field on an existing tool, non-breaking — clients that ignore the field continue to work).

Motivation: a maintainer triaging a failed corpus today can see *that* documents failed (existing `indexing.errors` counter) but not *which* documents or *why*. The information already exists in the implementation's metadata store (per-document `error_message`) and ships in `dir2mcp support-bundle`'s `list-files.json`; this spec change makes it available programmatically through the spec-blessed diagnostic surface (`stats`) so doctor-style dashboards and remote diagnostics can render it without scraping the bundle.

- §15.6 `dir2mcp_stats` output: optional `recent_failures` array (`additionalProperties: false`), each item `{rel_path, doc_type, mtime_unix, error_message}` (all required when an item is present), newest-first by `mtime_unix`. Implementations SHOULD cap at 20 entries by default and SHOULD cap `error_message` at 512 bytes on a UTF-8 rune boundary with control characters stripped (one-line render). Implementations MAY omit the field entirely when no failures are recorded; clients MUST treat omission as "no recent failures" (not "unsupported") per the existing "Clients MUST ignore unknown fields" rule. `error_message` is normative as a **diagnostic** signal — it MUST NOT contain secrets, raw file content, or unsanitized provider response bodies.
- `spec/tools/schemas/stats.json`: mirrored.
- No new tool, no new error code, no config-shape change. `spec/errors/taxonomy.md`, the rest of `spec/tools/schemas/*`, and the `dirstral-conformance` suites are unaffected (a new conformance test for the optional field is recommended-not-required).
- Implementation note: dir2mcp reference impl 0.5.8+ persists per-document `documents.error_message` (additive SQLite migration; introduced in dir2mcp #212). The stats wiring lands in a follow-up dir2mcp PR once this spec change is merged.

## 0.7.0 — multi-provider model abstraction

Generalizes the model pipeline from Mistral-centric to **provider-agnostic**: every capability (embed/chat/ocr/stt/rerank) binds to a configurable provider profile. A `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy — it is both a config-shape break (the monolithic `mistral:` block is removed) and new optional surface; a clean break is acceptable (no compatibility users). Design: [docs/design/0001-multi-provider.md](../docs/design/0001-multi-provider.md).

- §1 **Implementation goal** rewritten provider-agnostic; Mistral is the default profile, not privileged.
- §8.1 **Provider model**: profiles (`kind` = `openai`/`mistral`/`anthropic`/`gemini`/`cohere`/`elevenlabs`), the OpenAI-compatible backbone covering OpenAI/OpenRouter/Groq/Azure/local **and Mistral chat+embed**, bespoke adapters only for non-OpenAI surfaces (Mistral `/v1/ocr`, Anthropic, Cohere rerank, ElevenLabs).
- §8.1.2 **Capability matrix** (normative): binding a capability to an incapable `kind` is `CONFIG_INVALID`.
- §8.1.3 **Provider selection**: explicit `<cap>.provider`, else capability-driven auto-pick by precedence among credentialed+capable profiles (generalizes the rerank/STT rule).
- §8.1.4 **Embeddings corpus-lifetime invariant**: embed identity is bound to the index; mismatched reload MUST error or reindex (no silent vector-space mixing).
- §8.1.5 **Asymmetric embeddings (input role)**: every embedding call carries a document/query input role; asymmetric providers (Cohere `input_type`, Voyage) MUST honor it, symmetric providers ignore it. The reference `Embedder` interface gains the role parameter (clean internal pre-1.0 break).
- **Full Cohere**: `kind: cohere` serves embed + chat (`/v2/chat`) + rerank in 0.7.0 (not rerank-only).
- **Provider-agnostic STT/TTS**: §8.2/§8.3 generalized — STT/TTS are selected per §8.1.3 among capable profiles (Mistral/ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Gemini for STT; ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Gemini for TTS). `kind: openai` audio is endpoint-dependent (validated at first use, never `CONFIG_INVALID`); every other matrix `✅` is statically valid. No provider is left half-wired.
- §16.2 config template: monolithic `mistral:` replaced by `providers:` map + `model:` capability bindings; `stt:`/`rerank:` shapes retained.
- §2.5 startup preflight generalized from "requires Mistral API key" to per-capability provider credentials.
- **No new tool, tool-schema field, or error code** (one new config-validation case reuses `CONFIG_INVALID`). `spec/tools/schemas/*` and `spec/errors/taxonomy.md` unchanged; `dirstral-conformance` unaffected.

## 0.6.0 — optional reranking (Cohere)

New **optional** retrieval-quality stage; capability-driven (auto-activates only when a rerank provider credential is present, off otherwise), non-breaking — `MINOR` bump per the pre-1.0 policy (new optional surface → `MINOR`).

- §8.4 **Rerank providers (optional)**: Cohere (`POST /v2/rerank`, default `rerank-v3.5`); capability-driven activation (auto-on when a credential is present, mirroring embedding/OCR provider gating); `rerank.enabled` is a tri-state override (unset → auto, `false` → force off, `true` → require + warn/fail-open if absent); fail-open; key not persisted.
- §9.1.1 **Optional reranking**: post-fusion re-scoring of the top `rerank.candidate_pool` (default 50) candidates before truncation to `k`; reorder-only (result structure §9.2 unchanged); `index=both` reranks once on the merged pool; deterministic tie-break by `chunk_id`.
- §16.2 config template: `rerank:` block (mirrors the `stt:` provider-selector shape).
- No new tool, tool-schema field, or error code (fail-open surfaces no new tool error). `spec/tools/schemas/*` and `spec/errors/taxonomy.md` unchanged.

## 0.5.0 — reconcile shipped dir2mcp (spec-gap resolution)

Protocol-council decision: the dir2mcp reference implementation had shipped behavior that diverged from canonical `0.4.0`. Per the pre-1.0 beta policy and the "spec is authoritative; maintainers decide spec-vs-impl direction" rule, all of the following were resolved **impl → spec** (the spec now ratifies shipped behavior); breaking deltas bump `MINOR` (`0.4.0 → 0.5.0`):

- **Tool naming** `dir2mcp.<tool>` → `dir2mcp_<tool>` (breaking; ratifies dir2mcp #172). The former dotted-namespace rule is **superseded** — underscore form is canonical across `docs/SPEC.md`, `spec/tools/schemas.md`, and every `spec/tools/schemas/*.json` title.
- **`rep_type` enum** `ocr_markdown` → `extracted_markdown` (breaking; ratifies dir2mcp #152 docling extractor abstraction).
- **`k` default** `10` → `15` for `search`/`ask`/`ask_audio`/`transcribe_and_ask` (ratifies dir2mcp #163).
- **`OCR_NOT_READY`** tool-execution error added + `open_file` binary-doc semantics + `span.kind="document"` variant (new optional; ratifies dir2mcp #180).
- **`serverInfo.name`** per-instance auto-derivation + `dir2mcp-dev-` prefix for dev builds (new optional; ratifies dir2mcp #184/#185).
- **x402 adapter**: facilitator defaults to the Coinbase x402 Go SDK client (clarification).

`dirstral-conformance` SHOULD extend suites for the renamed tool surface before any impl releases against `0.5.0`.

## Breaking change process

1. Open a spec PR with the proposed change
2. Maintainer review required (protocol council gate)
3. Bump the version in `spec/versioning.md` (while `0.x`: breaking → `MINOR` per the pre-1.0 policy; post-`1.0`: `MAJOR`)
4. All implementation repos must update their compatibility matrix before releasing against the new spec version
5. `dirstral-conformance` must add a new test suite for the new behavior

## Non-breaking additions

New optional tools or optional fields in existing tool schemas may be added in a minor version without breaking existing clients. Clients MUST ignore unknown fields.
